            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The State of the Visible Church upon Earth under Desertion.</head>
            <div n="1" type="maxim">
               <head>The First Maxime.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the Church visible may fall sometimes into a State of Desertion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY the Church visible is meant either a particular Church, or the collective general Church. That any particular Church may be deserted, and totally exterminated, either by means of persecution, or in progress of time by its own proper defection from the faith, and Orthodox truth of Christ, appears by these Arguments;</p>
               <p>First, the Word of God asserts it, <hi>Hos. 2. 3. Jer. 7. 12, 14▪ 15. Rev.</hi> 2. 5. and 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Experience confirms it in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Ephesus, Laodicea, Jerusalem,</hi> and many other instances, God having long since removed his golden Candlestick from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There can no special Promise of Priviledge or exemption be shewed to secure any particular Church from this danger.</p>
               <p>Again, By the Church visible may be meant the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive or general Church upon earth, which are all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches consider'd together: And of this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is also meant in some sort, that it may come to pass that all the external particular visible Churches may as to common apprehension, fall away from the true Worship of God by a general Cataclysme; so as that the whole visible
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46468:4"/> Church of Christ here upon earth may seem to be cast off, and forsaken of God and abolished. Proofs of this:</p>
               <p>First, Under the Old Testament the Prophets bewailed such defections and desertions. The Church being reduced to so obscure a State and Condition, as that no outward and visible face of the Church appeared in publike any where; neither were the Members of the true Church able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern one another, as in the dayes of <hi>Elias, 1 Kin.</hi> 19, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Under the Gospel we finde, That Christ and his Apostles have foretold, that many should fall from the Faith, yea, that there should be a general Apostasie and falling away, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. And so strong should the defection be, as that, if it were possible, the Elect themselves should fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. And when the Son of Man should come he should scarce finde faith on the earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8. A Caution. Yet notwithstanding it can never be that all the particular societies and Churches should be really extinguished, and utterly corrupted, and laid aside from the true Worship of God; but that alway God will keep some true worshippers▪ more or less, whose assemblies, though obscure, doth consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a true Church for the promise of Christ shall preserve the Church from utter and reall extirpation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="maxim">
               <head>The Second Maxime.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the State of Desertion is, Gods hiding of his face<note place="margin">The state of Desertion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> from his people generally, and leaving them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with great afflictions, and that for a very long season, <hi>Psal. 44. 23, 24, 25.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe hiding of Gods face</hi> implies three things: First, The with-holding of his gracious Spirit in Counsel, that should direct us what is best to be done, and in what manner to do it, and a want of his fostering grace that should help
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46468:4"/> us to do all things: in our straits God seems incogitant of us, asleep and taking no great notice of our distresses, fears, fasts prayers, changes, designs that are carried on. As when God refused to answer <hi>Saul</hi> when he asked counsel: Or to give the Church any tokens of his presence, any Prophets that could<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 9.</note> tell them how long the affliction should endure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The hiding of Gods face implies, the delivering up of a people to strong delusions, violent temptations; a giving them up to their own hearts lusts and counsels, that they might eat the fruit of their own doings, <hi>Prov</hi> 1. 30, 31. and Satans delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: As in <hi>Ahabs</hi> case, God delivering him up and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to the suggestion of a lying spirit, that he might fall at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead</hi> in battel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implies, great displeasure in Gods heart against a people All three Persons in the blessed Trinity deelaring against them, as a people turned off and divorced, who are no longer in league with him, 2 <hi>Chr. 15. 2. Deut. 31. 16, 17. Hos.</hi> 1. 9, 8, 7, 6. The Father counting them a burthen upon his heart until he be eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 24. He will hear no intercessor for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 1. He will cast them out of his sight, and not suffer them to stand any longer before him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 1. Yea, he will appoint them to several fearful judgements, v. 2. He will at length scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them abroad into other Kingdomes and places, v. 4. and will harden the hearts of men against them in their Captivity, that none shall pity them, v. 5. Christ the staff of beauty is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken over their heads, they have no benefit from Jesus Christ and his Intercession and blood to keep the peace between God and them any longer; their names are in a manner crossed out of Christs Ephod, He puts off those sweet names and gracious titles of High Priest, King, Elder Brother, Husband, Saviour, Advocate; and puts on terrible names and marches out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them upon his Fathers Commission. He calls himself a furious teased Lion, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 14, 15. that will tear and none shall dare rescue them. A Leopard for subtilty, <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 7.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46468:5"/> to catch them unawares; a Bear bereft of her whelps, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. that shall devour with fury; a piercing East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. that shall dry up root and branch; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 8. A cruel archer, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 12, 13. a resolute terrible enemie, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 3, 4, 5, to 15. Lastly, the Spirit of God dis-owns them: 1. He ceases to strive with them by inward counsels upon their hearts. 2. He fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, testifying out of Gods Word and by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and every Judgement perpetually against them. 3. By witnessing in heaven against them; for as it is the Spirits office to witness sometimes for us, so upon this occasion he bears witness against us; as he intercedes sometimes with us, so now he cryes and groans against us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. this makes God swear solemnly that he will destroy such a people for grieving so kinde a Messenger.</p>
               <p>Thus Desertion appears to be a hiding of Gods face; three Circumstances yet remain in the definition to be opened.</p>
               <p>Its a hiding of Gods face from a people <hi>generally:</hi> every cloud upon the Sun that shadows our place does not make night, but when the Sun is down, and all the Horizon in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point obscured, then 'tis night: So afflictions or Gods hiding his face from some particular soul does not make a deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; but when it is general, a damp upon every family, upon all ranks and conditions, Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, then 'tis a plain desertion, as these places of Scripture testifie, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21. and 10. <hi>v. 22, 23. Isai.</hi> 1. 5. 6. 4.<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note> 7, 8, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>Again, it is not the close of Gods favour or hiding of his face in some degree that layeth a people in this forlorn estate, but Desertion is a loss of grace and favour in an <hi>eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> high dis-favour, a leaving them to be exercised with great afflictions: the absence of a Nurse from the Child is not straightway a forsaking of it, or a letting it fall as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheths</hi> Nurse did him, but a casting it out of her arms as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46468:5"/>
                  <hi>Hagar</hi> did <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and going away that she might not see it die: At the beginning God was but lightly displeased with <hi>Saul,</hi> but at last he finds that God had forsaken him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to an evil spirit; at first God lightly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the people of <hi>Israel</hi> by his Prophets, but they taking no notice, God leaves them wholly in their enemies hands, as the Prophet <hi>Zecharie</hi> notes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. Or else we may count upon it that Desertion comes on by degrees, as God was noted to go out from before the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims and stand upon the threshold, and from the threshold of the Sanctuary to a mountain neer the Citie, and at last quite away; so God deserts his people not all of a sudden, but as a gracious father loath to depart, he forsakes by little and little, warning them to repent, but if our heart grows hard, his heart hardens too, till he have at last cast off his people.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In times of Desertion the three Essential Marks of a true<note place="margin">Symptomes and signs of Desertion.</note> Church visible, are exceedingly lost, blurred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe first Essential Note of a true visible Church (agreed upon by all men) is the <hi>pure, faithful preaching of the Word of God;</hi> for if <hi>you abide in my word,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>then are you my disciples indeed,</hi> John 10. 27. therefore the Church is said to be <hi>built upon the foundation of the Prophets
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46468:6"/> and Apostles,</hi> that is upon the Doctrine and truth delivered by the Prophets and Apostles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. and the Church is hereby defined; <hi>Coetus in quo verbum Dei purè praedicatur est vera Ecclesia, quemadmodum è converso;</hi> now in times of desertion the Scriptures and written Word of God are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 2, 3, 5, 6. Rev. 2. 14, 15, 16, 20.</note> for a rule, and self inventions and carnal policies take place; the pure cleer truths of the Word wrested and baffled or put off by Governors and their people, and a false word and rule accepted of; the kingdom of God resisted that it cannot take place, and false errors spread boldly and connived at, there being no publike profession and Church-agreement in the Articles of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>The Second Essential Note of a true Church that enjoys communion with God is, That <hi>therein the holy Sacraments are purely and faithfully administred▪</hi> For Christ hath not onely left a word to be taught his Disciples, but for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in a greater measure in the truth, hath annext cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain visible rites which are used as certain <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Seals which are appendent to his Word. For the Writing and Seals put together give us the greater confidence in Christ in whom are the Promises. When therefore these Seals are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed religiously, according to Christs holy institution in the Churches, then it argues, they are the true Churches of Christ to all the world; but when these are laid aside or vitiated and corrupted wilfully, then will God desert his people; for this<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4, 5. and 3. v. 15, 16, 19, 20, 21.</note> Reason it was that God accounted the shame of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be upon his people, until at <hi>Gilgal</hi> they rouled it away by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Sacrament of Circumcision; there being no mark of God more upon them before, then was upon the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third Note of a true Church of Christ is, <hi>That</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxia <hi>or Holy Discipline that Christ hath instituted for the cutting off of scandalous offenders and fostering of the true babes of Christ in all grace.</hi> Wherefore where Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Discipline is rightly dispensed according to the Canons of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46468:6"/> Christ and his Apostles, there is an evident note of a true Church: but where this is laid aside, it notes out a Synagogue of Satan rather then a Church of Christ: in Christs flock his lambs are tractable and willing to be disciplined; but wild Wolvs and Asses are not easily held and tamed.

               <head>The Fifth Maxime.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In times of Desertion; Abominable Corruptions grow in Courts of Justice, and great Councels of the Land. And False-Worship, Errors and Lukewarmness overspreads the Churches.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrst, abominable corruptions appear in Courts of Justice, and great Councils of the Land: Gods Vine yeelded him but wild grapes, <hi>Isai. 5. 4. He looked for judgment but behold oppression, for righteousness but behold a cry,</hi> vers. 7. Then he decrees to take away the hedge of the Vineyard, and break down the wall thereof, and lay his vine waste, that it should not be pruned nor digged any more, but choaked with briars and thorns that grew about it and over-top'd it; then he commands the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. Now Justice fails either in the Legislative power, or the executive power of a Kingdom these wayes: First, in the Legislative power of the Kingdom, when the power that should extend it self in making of necessary Laws for the relief of the oppressed, is restrained; therefore in all difficult cases <hi>Moses</hi> allowed the Judges to come to him, and he through the Counsel of God made additional Laws, as occasion required, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. and 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8. to 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 1, &amp;c. otherwise justice had failed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When unjust Laws are continued or corrupt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of good Laws go for Presidents uncontrolled, which ought timely to be reformed least Oppression it self be made a Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When fundamental constitutions in Courts of Justice are ill laid, Officers being either exorbitant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, Charges and Fees too great; Juries made in a mixt way of good and bad men, ignorant and unable to judge in difficult cases; Parties not suffered to speak for themselves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46468:8"/> whereby many righteous causes have been betraid and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, Places of Justice set to sale, and the like.</p>
               <p>In the Executive power likewise: First, When Judges, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Magistrates put off the complaints of the oppressed for want of gifts, not willing to move for their relief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hire, whereas they are bound to help them readily upon complaint, <hi>Exod. 23. 8. Deut. 16. 19. Isai.</hi> 1. 23. Secondly, When Judges and Magistrates, Counsellors, Juries, and all conspire together to overthrow a righteous cause for filthie lucre sake, <hi>Micah 3. 11. Ezek. 22. 12. Deut.</hi> 27. 25. this hath a solemn Curse upon it, <hi>Isai.</hi> 5. 23. Thirdly, When Justice is delayed beyond what is meet, after that the cause hath been throughly heard, by shifts and tricks of Law, to toil and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the oppressed in seeking their right, <hi>Hab. 1. 2, 3, 4. Isai.</hi> 59. 14. Fourthly, When through favour, or affection, or by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects a wrong doer is acquitted, and let go unpunished; <hi>Jer. 5. 28. 1 Kings</hi> 40. 42. 5. When a wicked person is not onely connived at and spared, but also assoiled as guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and justified in Court, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. and 24. 24.</p>
               <p>Again, When False-Worships, Errors, Lukewarmness, over-spreads the Churches. 1. Either when Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and False worships are allowed of, or connived at, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. 2. When there is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the true Worship of God, and drawing off from Gods Ordinances and holy Church-fellowship. Princes and Nobles giving no example of obedience and zeal for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in their own persons and families, nor putting forth their authority for encouraging the service of God. And the people (a few scattered ones only excepted) generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Gospel-worship, and cold and indifferent about religion <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15, 16. both in publike and private. 3. When abominable destructive Errors and Heresies are spread abroad and take with men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>

               <head>The sixth Maxime.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In times of Desertion; generally Grace decays; Sin grows ripe. Judgments are augmented, and at length Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is decreed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GRace decays. First, in the Principle of life; the Holy Spirit with-holding his counsels, quicknings, sweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gracious strivings. 2. Grace decays in its vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and working, so that men are not so vigorous for God, and ready to good works and cheerful in duties as they were. 3. Grace decays in the extent, when Love grows cold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and our brethren: Faith is scarce to be found, men are difficult in receiving Gospel-truths and Gospel-commands that are of great importance, the word not made a rule, nor savorie in its precious consolations. No delightful expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs appearing; zeal for God very rare, and low; and little delight in communion with God. 4. Grace decays in its effects. 1. When there is not much comfort in mens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits but doubts, fears, wounds, scars, complaints. 2. When Satan takes courage against Christians, and comes on with great wrath and violence, as a Conqueror when he fees his enemies give ground, and cast away their shields comes on with power. 3. Christians are like foolish Virgins drowsie and unprepared for Christs coming.</p>
               <p>Sin grows ripe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. 7. 11▪ 12, 13. 1. Sin grows ripe, when the root is come to its full magnitude; now the root of sin is the love of sin; when men allow themselves in their sin, and hate him and persecute him that reproves him in the gate, having a fixed purpose to go on their way, whatsoever God and his Spirit and Ministers say against it. 2. Sin grows ripe when the branches are many and large; great enormous crimes are the branches of sin, great pride, and vain glorious pomp and state, greedy coveting of worldly things; oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46468:9"/> of the poor, and afflicted, rioting, and high jollitie joyned with an insensibleness of the sad judgments of God abroad, and the afflictions of Gods distressed <hi>Joseph;</hi> profanation of the Sabbath, contempt of Gods Word, and counsel of his faithful Ministers; persecution of the godly, <hi>Isai 5. 8, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Levit. 26. 14, 15, 34, 35, 43. 2 Chron.</hi> 26. 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. <hi>Luke 21. 12, 16, 17. Amos</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. 3. Sin grows ripe, when its pestilential shadow spreads large over all sorts and conditions of men, Court and Country, Prince and Prophets, Cities, Universities, Courts of justice, and Councels of the Nation, killing by its dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quality every plant that is set under it. 4. Sin grows ripe, when its fruit grows mellow, men being imboldned in sin and facilitated to it to commit sin with ease, and without check of conscience, steeled against the reproofs of God, taking up a resolution of <hi>Sceler a sceleribus tuenda.</hi> Old monstrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded sins and errors being revived amongst men.</p>
               <p>Judgments are augmented: God begins his reproof of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with easier judgements at first, and then raises them higher and higher, making one take what the other left, God sometimes rises by seven fold, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 16. to 39. <hi>Joel</hi> 1, 2,<note place="margin">Mat. 24 8. 7. 6.

               <head>The seventh Maxime.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In times of Desertion terrible preternatural accidents are set forth by the hand of God in the Heavens and Elements, to give men warning and work them over to a holy fear of the Lord and his judgments; dreadful and unusual Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Comets, flaming Swords, Apparitions in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; intension of light, or creation of some new Star in the eight Sphere; the Sea, and Earth, and Fire, being a womb of frequent, monstrous and extraordinary dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects, monstrous births amongst mankinde and beasts, <hi>Luke 21. 11, 25, 26. Joel 2. 30, 31.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw what more sad and dreadful condition can people fall into then to be forsaken of God, and yet it is hard for us to be convinced that we are under such a condition, or going apace into it: First, because it comes on gradually; Gods departure is not altogether of a suddain, but by little and little, and therefore the more insensible; the Lord notes it in his people when he tels them, <hi>that gray hairs are here and there upon them, and yet they could not be perswaded that they grew old because old age had crept upon them by little and little;</hi> yea, God had set fire round about them, and burnt them up, yet they did not feel themselves hurt.</p>
               <p>A second Reason is, Men take up with the outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some Ordinances in a formality, and are contented with a little Religion, so that as long as they have something left of Religion they are well enough contented; the Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> served <hi>Israels</hi> turn, as well as the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in <hi>Judah;</hi> they cryed, <hi>the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> at the very last, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were well enough, because they had a little form and outside of Religion left.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more God draws off from us, the greater our insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibleness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46468:10"/> grows; and therefore we cannot discern Gods depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for want of a sensible heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some mens portion is still fat, and they want not for mirth and all fulness, and therefore they think all is well; this temptation is apt to hold those that are in great power and places, as it did <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and his Princes, and the Lords of the Philistines when they delayed and sent the Ark about from citie to citie, thinking all that mortality was but a chance, and all that while it reach'd not unto them it was well enough.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Reas.</hi> Some men are intangled in their own particular troubles and interests, as they cannot be at leasure to think how it is with the publike and Church of God: Thus a strange stupiditie grows upon the hearts of men, and the farther they go off from God, the more miserable and more insensible of their misery.</p>
               <p>The Lord convince us, the Lord who onely can deal with a heart of stone, and pull it out of our bosomes, when it passes all the art of Men and Angels; the Lord, I say, convince us before it be too late, and state this case aright: How is it with us! How it is between us and him? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it would be the greatest point of our wisdom to inquire into the truth of this our present case, which though sadly hinted at now and then by the gracious and faithful Ministers of this age, yet has not hitherto been stated <hi>ex professo</hi> by any; We want not, Oh blessed be God, that yet we want not faithful able Prophets and Seers that would give counsel from the Lord, and shew us how great our danger is, and what is to be applied as a Remedie, unless we mean to let all go for lost, and past recovery. Thus they said in <hi>Jeremies</hi> time, <hi>There is no hope, there is no remedy, past cure;</hi> and in <hi>Samuels</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 25.</note> time, though they had wise and godly Ministers of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and a Prophet, so singular a Prophet, as that <hi>Samuel</hi> was, by whom God spake so evidently, yet asked they not after the Lord in his time for 20 yeers together. O ye vigilant Shepherds of Gods people, ye Princes and Ministers of the Church of God, see you to this betimes, for it chiefly concerns
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46468:10"/> you, for verily in times of Desertion, the heaviest blowes of Gods displeasure in general judgments are most sure to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, if you sit careless and mindless of the flock in this condition: <hi>Woe to the idle Shepherd that regardeeh not the state of the flock, the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his righe eye, his arm shall be clean dryed up; and his right eye shall be utterly darkned, saith the Lord.</hi> Alas! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Zech. 11. 17.</note> men had not died if they had not been over confident of their life; and how many goodly Kingdomes and Churches had not been over-thrown, if they had not been secure when the mighty hand of God was lifted up against them, this is our temper we know not our time. <hi>Man knoweth not his time</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) but like as the fish is caught in an evil net because he knoweth not his time:</hi> so is man; he takes not his time to avoid the danger that is gathering about him.</p>
               <p>What is our case? is it nothing to us? all this that hath been spoken, is it nothing to us? Ah, I wish heartily it did not at all concern mine own Country; may that ever be the blessed aboad of Gods presence and never be forsaken; but is it in truth nothing to us? like <hi>Nathans</hi> parable to <hi>David</hi> doleful story, but nothing to him until the Prophet said, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Then give me leave, O beloved <hi>England,</hi> and dear Christian brethren, give me leave in very faithfulness and love, and deerest love, and dolour of my very heart to say, that that is the case of this afflicted Land and Nation. We have surely been under a great measure of Desertion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and what the end will be, I dread to think; its true, we are not yet wholly given up, but yet I grieve to say, we are far gone, and promise our selves better times then I see ground for. Look back upon the years that are past; for these thirty years together and more, how little of God hath beene in our Civil and Ecclesiastical Councels? Yea, what a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was there in that Kings Reign, by prostituting the Word, Sacraments and Sabbaths of God, and abusing and banishing the Godly Ministers of the Land? What a conspiracy was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46468:11"/> there to drive God out of the Land, and the purity and power of true Religion, and set up Superstition and profancness? and certainly there hath been a great miss of Gods presence, even in the great Councels of the Nation in these latter times. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God hath stirred up the spirit of his faithful Ministers, who delivered the mind of God to them, as appears by several Sermons upon record against this generation; but their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have not been hearkened to, they turned away the shoulder even to this day, and have not accepted of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God offered to them: Go search through the Tribes of our <hi>Israel,</hi> and see how small the number is of those that bear up a profession of Christs name, but generally how opposite are the people of the Land to the work of Reformation? which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the very great work that Christ calls for in these dayes if we mean to prevent our ruine that cometh on fast upon us. This I have noted, as a fatal mark upon a people and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little before their destruction, that God said of them, <hi>They would none of my Counsel, they despised all my reproof, they put out the eyes of their very Seers, and said to their Seers, see not, and to the Prophets prophecy not;</hi> now how are a people like to have the counsel of God, when they say (as that wretched <hi>Ahab</hi>) of their Prophets, <hi>They hate us and will prophecy no good bus evil to us;</hi> they cry down the advice of holy Ministers and Church councels, as needless, by whom if by any upon earth, God uses to send his counsel to the nations, then to be sure the destruction of that people is nigh, God is not amongst them; <hi>They dig deep; saith the Lord, to hide their counsels from me, and when they cry I will not hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, how have we been delivered up to our own counsels, and toiled in our own devices, and carried about with the fierce tempest of strong temptations through manifold mutations back and forth, which wise states-men use to observe as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running cause of the overthrow of Republikes, as Physicians do also of their sick men, when they cry, carry me from bed to bed for I find no ease, then is death nigh: Thus are we toiled
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46468:11"/> till our hearts be almost broken, and no one knows what to do, or what to advise poor <hi>Sion</hi> crying out, is there none of my sons that I have brought up that is able to help me? Divisions, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, self-seeking have toffed men about like light chaffe in a whirle-wind. How has the whole blessed Trinity groaned over us and stirred with great indignation against us. The Father ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off his people, as if they were a burthen upon his heart; reaching as if he would spue them out of his mouth into other lands, yea out of the land of the living, throwing thousands and hundreds of thousands into the grave. How has the Lord Christ watched like a Lion, and like a Leopard, and catched the very choice ones of the flock and rent them in pieces? How has the Spirit striven and reproved this people till he be now almost wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? for methinks I see that blessed and most active Spirit sitting down and saying, I will strive no more, if they will be a lost peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple let them be lost, I have done, I have done with them, the work of conversion shall cease, let the world now make converts of them and their posterity.</p>
               <p>Again, Note how <hi>generally</hi> hath the wrath of the Lord gone through the land even almost to make a full end: what County, what City or Country, what family in these three Nations hath not tasted of the bitter cup of Gods displeasure; and that too in <hi>a very terrible manner,</hi> yea and for <hi>a long season too?</hi> Wrath hath been climbing higher and higher, even for these 30 years, and if the ancient ones might speak, perhaps they would set the account higher.</p>
               <p>Look upon the three great marks of the Church of Christ upon earth, and see how they are clouded and darkned: How is the word slighted, dis-savour'd, quenched? The holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thrown by and fled from, as if the flesh of Christ were not our meat, but our bane, and we could be better without it. The peace and order and Government of the Church broken to shivers and cast off, so that unless I look into some by-corners of the Nation, here and there, I can scarce find the splinters and relickes of the true notes of the holy Church of Christ amongst
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46468:12"/> us. O sad word; what are we declining to after all our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, vowes declarations? what will we fall off from the Church of Christ like withered leaves in winter, will we banish our selves, exclude our selves, flie from the sweet and precious spouse of Christ, and mother that bare us, and paps that gave us suck? Look farther yet upon the Ordinances of Magistracy and Ministry and look with wakeing eyes, and with sighing hearts: are these become as dead corps, a liveless Effigies, little vigour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and power in them? do they lye in thy streets. O Sodom, like the slain witnesses, fitter for the grave then for the Throne, whiles the profane ones make merry with the liberty they have, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over them as those, that whiles they had the power of God were bonds and cords to them and tormented them. What sad breakings have our eyes seen upon Parliaments, and Princes, and Councels, as if the Lord did say, in vain do you trust in broken cisterns when you have forsook the cistern of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water. We have had a little hope sometimes, and said, but now we hope God hath provided faithful zealous magistrates for his people, and painful ministers, but how soon hath God turned his hand and took them away again? yea how soon have they turned their hearts and said, we have no power in the things of God, if the Lord be God he will plead for himself? See and acknowledg what checks have been set against many good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of repairing the breaches of the Nation, and setling the Government thereof in righteousness, when we are carried back again into <hi>Egypt</hi> almost. Look upon our Courts of Justice and wisest Councels of the Nation, and do not they answer the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as that King of Israel, <hi>Alas! if God do not help we cannot help;</hi> is there not a great cry of the oppressed in the land, surely God hears it. What luke-warmness and indifferency upon the Churches? the best complain of decay of vigour for God, of the growth of sin, of the continuance of judgments; as that poor people so are we, <hi>we roare like bears and mourn like doves.</hi> Yea lastly, consider, hath not God wrote dreadful characters in the heavens and earth, enough to make the stoutest spirited <hi>Belshazer</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46468:12"/> tremble if he had any sense left, and do not we yet conclude of our danger? What is it that bears up our hopes? What <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> would we object; would we say, we hope no such danger? for God has set up amongst us godly magistrates and ministers now adayes? Blessed be God for them; but yet this argues not but that there has been a great desertion upon the land aforetime, and even yet also it may continue: God set up godly Magistrates in the raign of <hi>Josiah</hi> over Judah, and yet their desolation and captivity was not prevented.</p>
               <p>But there is some little work of reformation begun, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>2</label> we hope God means not to cast off the Nation.</p>
               <p>So it was in <hi>Josiahs</hi> time likewise, and <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> time there was a very glorious work begun by <hi>Josiah,</hi> and the worship of God set up with more solemnity ten times then now a dayes; Prince and people joyning like one man in that blessed work, and yet it prevented not their ruine; whereas the reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us is so little, and the opposition so eminent; that I must say, that even for this, for the very discouraging and opposing of the kingdome of God amongst us, we deserve to be all ruined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Oh! <hi>tell it not in Gath and publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh it not in Ashkelon, least the uncircumci ed of the Nations mock at our shame, for what Nation has had God so nigh them,</hi> offer'd to them in his Gospel, and invited by so many great salvations, and answer of prayers in our calamity, as this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> and yet we do not own God as he expects, which makes him go on in a course of judgments amongst us still.</p>
               <p>But God has done well for his people in these sad times; casting <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>3</label> out their enemies that sought their subversion and the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the true Worship of God, and giving his people liberty in their profession, and exalting them in the room of those that held them in bondage, and therefore we hope these are not times of desertion.</p>
               <p>I answer two ways to this Objection: First, that it is usual with God thus to do in times of general desertion, to minde in a special manner his poor peoples good; when he leaves other things to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46468:13"/> plunder, yet at that time he makes up his jewels, and hides them in a safe place: when he strikes at all, yet he knows where his blows<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 5.</note> fall, and he lays the heavier end of his staff upon his foes, whiles his children crowd under his arm, and least there should be any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, he sets a mark in their foreheads too, that he may be sure to make a difference. But yet because they are spared, it does not argue that others were not beaten, and because he passes by their door posts, it cannot be said there was no general plague in <hi>Egypt.</hi> This is the very thing that God aims at in general desertions, to refine his people thereby, and so to settle their peace; see <hi>Isai.</hi> 5. 13. compared with 17. When God had said, <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge, and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst;</hi> but what, is it so with Gods own choice people, doth the Lord make no difference? Note what follows, <hi>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat:</hi> it does not follow therefore, that it is no time of desertion upon the Land, because God provides well for his people at such time.</p>
               <p>Again, take another answer, The desertion may not be yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it may fall heavy, though you have been spared hitherto, your turn may come next, and the sooner because of your ingratitude, unfruitfulness and security under judgments; nay if you come in the room of those that God cast out before you, and sin even as they, it shall be worse with you then with them, as God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his people when he dis-possessed the <hi>Amorites</hi> to make room for <hi>Israel.</hi> Now ah! doth not your apostasie and lukewarmness, yea coldness in love and zeal, and drawing back from holy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Gospel precious Ordinances? yea, doth not oppression, pride, worldliness, hardness of heart, and loosness, and other abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable filthiness of <hi>Sodom,</hi> witness against you that profess bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things? therefore I fear there will come a time wherein those also shall have their share. <hi>Hear ye that are afar off, what</hi> I <hi>have done saith the Lord, and ye that are near acknowledge my might. The sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulness hath surprized the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46468:13"/> hypocrites: Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly, he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 33.</note>
                  <hi>bribes, that stoppeth his ear from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evill: He shall dwell on high, his place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence shall be the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is your opinion onely; who is there of those famous <label type="milestone">

But what Witnesses joyn with you in this: That the State of the Church hath been for many yeers, and yet is a State of Desertion?</p>
               <p>Indeed I must confess I have not met with any that have <hi>ex</hi>

                  <hi>professo</hi> stated this case, and therefore I had many waverings in my self in undertaking of it, and to say truth, I had never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured upon it, had not the Lord put the little book into my mouth and made me eat it before I published it; mybelly was made bitter with the disgust thereof, for so it pleased the Lord, first to lead me by the irresistible terrible hand of his soveraignty against much reluctancy of my spirit through this sad and doleful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that I might have experience of Gods dealing herein, and be more sensible of the Churches case. Now the light that the Lord had communicated to my heart, I durst not set under a bushel, for God seems to require it of me, and if I should with-hold it, in the consciousness of mine own infirmity, it would be to my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril. I know it is a sceptical age wherein we live, and the plainest truths of God are cavell'd at, and hard to be received, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men will hear, or whether they will forbear, God uses to give warning by his faithful Ministers, with whom his secret is, and I beseech the Lord to give his own people understanding, that they may know the thoughts and counsel of his heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And yet I think the Lord has not put me forth singly upon this work neither; but whiles I was thus fluctuating amongst
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46468:14"/> many discouragements, it pleased God to bring to my hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially the testimonies of several godly precious Ministers of this age (which has indeed abounded with many) collaterally abetting this truth, and strengthning my hands, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did <hi>Jerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Those that are more immediate and just at his coming, ye read of in the 20. of <hi>Math.</hi> v. 29. 30. <hi>Immmediately after the tribulatian of those dayes shall the Sun be darkned, and the Moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man comming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are yet to come, but those that are more remote, all seem to be past already, <hi>Before the coming of Christ</hi> (sayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>the man of sin shall be revealed,</hi> that is past; before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ there shall false Prophets arise, and say I am Christ, and another I am Christ, this is past: before the personal coming of Christ, there shall be wars and rumours of wars, this is past.</p>
               <p>And before that day, there shall be great divisions even in the matter of Religion; one saying, Lo here is Christ, and another, Lo there is Christ; this is already: and immediately before, and at his coming, men shall be smiting their fellow servants, eating and drinking with the drunken; this is already: the wise and foolish virgins shall be all a sleep, and was there ever a time when both wise and foolish were more a sleep then now? when men set themselves to sleep they draw their Curtains, put out their lights and will have no more light come in; so now. When men are asleep their senses are bound up that were open before, they see not, hear not, tast not, smell not, their senses are lockt up; sleep is <hi>ligatio sensuum.</hi> And was there ever time when mens senses were more bound up that were formerly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, then now? are there not some that would pray, and hear, and read, that will not now? who have now thrown off all duties, Ordinances, and means? O what sleeping is here? was there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46468:16"/> ever such sleeping among professors as now there is? if ever wise and foolish Virgins were asleep, they seem to be in our dayes.</p>
               <p>The same Reverend Author witnesses again, <hi>July</hi> the 15. 1649. in his Vindication of Ordinances on <hi>Deuter.</hi> 18. 15. pag. 27.</p>
               <p>I do exhort you, by the sweat of all your Ministers dead and living, by the love you bear to your own precious souls; hold and keep close to Ordinances in these declining times; see where they are in purity, and power, but keep close to them. I am perswaded that there is never a one of you but would be a friend to Christ, sayes Christ <hi>Then are you my friends if you do what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you.</hi> And can my heart tell me, that I am a friend to Christ if I cast off all his appointments, and all his Ordinances; I am perswaded that there is none of you, but desire to be the children of God. <hi>Wisdome is justified of her children,</hi> Christ is the wisdome of the Father, and if you be the children of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, you will justifie Christ in all his appointments, but if Christ the wisdome of the father shall give you such institutions and Ordinances, and you cast them off and say, they are low and fleshly and the like: Oh how will you justifie Christ the wisdom of the Father? wherefore I say, you that are professors, hold your hold in these declining times, and if you know any of your friends that are departed from the good Ordinances of God, Oh stand and mourn and lament over them, and say, alas! alas! my friend how is his crown fallen from his head; if you have a neighbour that hath a monster born in stead of a child, you will lam ent over your neighbour, and say, my neighbour instead of a sweet child hath an ugly monster with the head of a hog and the eares of an Asse: Ah my poor neighbour hath a monster born in her family. Why this <hi>Non-Ordinance</hi> is <hi>Englands</hi> monster and as people carry monsters up and down to shew them, so in other Countries they go up and down, and say, come and behold the English Monster, a thing never seen before, that Professors should deny Ordinances: And yet good Lord, how many families in this Kingdom have this Monster born there! Ah! will you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46468:17"/> not pray, weep, and lament over the families of your friends? Christian hold thy hold, in these sad and declining times hold thy hold.</p>
               <p>Another Witness is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Saints Rest, part 3. c. 5. <note place="margin">The 4th Witness.</note> Sect. 3. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1650. who complains thus, Christ hath been pleading with <hi>England</hi> these fourscore yeers and more, by the word of his Gospel, for his Worship, and for his Sabbaths, and yet the Inhabitants are not perswaded; nay he hath been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these six years by threatnings, and fire and sword, and yet can prevail but with very few; and though these bloodie arguments have been spread abroad, and brought home to people from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to Parish almost as far as the Word hath gone, so that there is scarce a Parish in many Counties where blood hath not been shed, and the bodies of the slain have not been left, yet multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in <hi>England</hi> are no more perswaded then they were the first day of their warning; and they have not heard the voice of the rod, which hath cryed up and down their streets, yet O <hi>England,</hi> will you not sanctifie my Sabbaths, nor call upon my Name, nor regard my word, nor turn from your worldliness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? God hath given them a lash and reproof, a wound, and a warning; he hath as it were stood in their blood with the sword in his hand, and among the heaps of the slain hath he pleaded with the living and said, what say you? will you not worship me, and fear me, and take me for your Lord? and yet they will not: Alas, yet to this day <hi>England</hi> will not! Let me here write it, and leave it upon record, that God may be justified, and <hi>England</hi> may be ashamed, and posterity may know if God do deliver us, how ill we deserved it, or if he destroy us how wilfully we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it; and if they that pass by shall ask, wherefore hath God done thus to a flourishing and prosperous Land? you may give them the true, though doleful answer, They would not hear, they would not regard, he smote them down, he wounded them, he hewed them as wood, and then beseeched the remainder to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and return, but they never would do it; they were weary of his ways, they were weary of his wayes, they polluted his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46468:17"/> they cast his word and worship out of their families, they would not be at the pains to learn and obey his will, nay, they abhorred his Ministers and servants, and holy paths, and all this at the last breath; when he had slain five thousand at a fight, the rest did no more reform, then if they had never heard of it: nay, such a spirit of slumber is fallen upon them, that if God should proceed, and kill them all save one man, and ask that one man, wilt thou yet seek me with all thy heart? he would rather slight it. Lord have mercy upon us! what is gone with mens understanding and senses? have they renounced reason as well as faith? are they dead naturally as well as spiritually? can they not hear and feel, though they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? that sad judgement is faln upon them mentioned in <hi>Isai. 42 24, 25. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel</hi> (England) <hi>to the robbers? did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his Laws; therefore he hath poured upon them the fury of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the strength of the battel, and it hath set them on fire round about, yet they knew it not; it burned them yet they laid it not to heart.</hi> Yea this much more let us leave upon record a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against <hi>England;</hi> they have been so far from reforming and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the worship of God with delight after all this, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes have contrarily abhorred it at the very heart, and fought against it as long as they could stand; and when they have been wounded and overthrown in one conflict, they have been as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the next, as if they had never felt the hand of God at all, and to root out the sincere worshippers and worship of God is their continued endeavour, and still they that succeed them do the like. Lord, how hast thou deserved so much ill at these mens hands! what harm hath praying, and reading, and preaching painfully, and sanctifying the Sabbath, and fearing to offend done to <hi>England?</hi> have they suffered for these, or for their enmity to these? And for the Discipline of Christ, though all parts of the world have much opposed it, yet where hath it been so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully resisted? the Lord grant that this hardned, willful, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46468:18"/> Nation fall not under that heavy doom, <hi>Luke 19. 27. But those mine enemies who would not that I should reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me.</hi>

               <p>Hear another witness for God against the present times, whom <note place="margin">Witness.</note> I should have named with the first, because his Testimony was given in his Sermon before the Parliament, <hi>August</hi> 13. 1644. I mean Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer</hi> upon <hi>Psal. 99. 8. p.</hi> 32, 35, 39. Those that some yeers ago made great Conscience of the Sabbath, and of family duties, are now many of them come even to question, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sabbath be at all to be observed or no?</hi> and though they deny not that family devotions are duties, yet they themselves do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ttle regard that their families should observe them; some that were by their own confession, so greatly conscientious of secret prayer, as that they could never omit it without an inward check, now do not make any the least shew that they take any time for it day or night. The faithful Ministers are set against, their tithes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd dues with-held and denied, with pretence one while that they are Jewish, another while that they are Popish, any thing that they may weary them out, and that they may have no Ministers at all, or only those that are altogether according to their own lusts; formerly even in ill times, a conscionable Minister in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could do somwhat toward the bringing his people to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, who now wholly cast off the yoke (because there is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neither Ecclesiastical nor Civil that they think will at all meddle with them, how refractory soever they be) and grow more brutish and barbarous every day then other. And now above all former times, whoredom and adultery do fearfully abound and grow impudent; even incest is to be found in divers places, and no punishment to be found for it. I cannot forbear putting you in minde of that expostulation of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 24. &amp;c. The people there flattered themselvs with a conceit that God intended to give them peace in possessing the land, from whence their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were driven or carried away captives. <hi>Abraham say they was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is given us for an inheritance;</hi> but God answers them with an appeal to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46468:18"/> their own consciences, and then with a peremptory threatning of the contrary, <hi>v.</hi> 25. &amp;c. <hi>You eate with the blood; and lift up your eyes toward your Idols, and shed blood, and shall ye possesse the land? Ye stand upon your Sword, ye work abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ye defile every one his neighbours wife; and shall ye possesse the land? Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Surely they that are in the wast shall fall by the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. Have not we too much of such confidence as they express? and yet no less cause to fear such an answer from God as that was. You thus and thus misbehave your selves, and shall you have peace? shal you have setling? shal you possess the land? may we not also much more admire the patience and longsuffering of God towards us all this while, that a complete vengeance hath not been taken upon our misdoings, as well as upon <hi>Germanies</hi> and <hi>Irelands</hi> and even upon some parts of our Kingdom and Nation? and if we sadly consider how God did not spare those faithful men the text points at, did not let faithful <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saints of the Lord, live to see the happiness of his people, inheriting the Land of Promise, may we not upon the remembrance of our greater provocations, tremble least none of us should be suffered to live to see an end of our troubles, and the Church of God peaceably setled in an holy Reformation? Sure we have no reason to expect it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we live to see and help to procure our own hearts, and lives, and families, and whole party, to be apparantly more faithful.</p>

                  </note> forewarning our danger, Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burroughs,</hi> in his Heart-Divisions, upon <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 2. c. 1. p. 203. [The Lord convince us of and humble us for the sinfulness of our Divisions by his Word, that desolating judgments be not upon us to convince and humble us. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Comment upon these words notes, That the Scripture, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. tels us, That <hi>Hoshea</hi> was the last King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and in his time <hi>Israel</hi> was carried Captive, yet v. 2. it is said <hi>He did not evil in the sight of the Lord▪ as the Kings of Israel that were before him.</hi> Now the Jewes put this question, Why was not <hi>Israel</hi> carried captive with their King, when they had the worst
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46468:19"/> King, but rather when things seemed to go something better then before? God yet chuses this time. The answer they give is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in former times the people might pretend they could not tell how to help what they did amiss in the matter of Worship. Indeed they worshipped the Calves, but they were forced to it by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their Kings; it should be the loss of all they had if they did not. But say they, in the dayes of <hi>Hoshea</hi> there was more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given then before: Now those who would might go up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> to worship; and that they say is the reason of that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, That <hi>Hoshea</hi> did not evil as other Kings had done; but when they came to have more liberty, they came to wranglings among themselves (which is an usual concomitant of liberty) now their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision rose high, some would go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship, others would not; those that went up, cryed out of those that went not; those that went not, vilified those that went. Now their hearts are thus divided, now shall they be found guilty; the desolating judgment must now come, this the time for their captivity, now he gives them up to the enemie; God was exceedingly provoked with their contentions one against another at this time. What? (sayes God) when I was in some way of favor towards them, when I took off (in great part) the yoke of Bondage that was upon them that sore oppression that was before, none of them (a while since) dared go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship, and now their Governors are more moderate, their oppressing Courts are down, there is more liberty in the Land for my true Worship, and do they fall out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, divide, wrangle one with another? Let them go into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, let the enemy come in upon them, my soul takes no delight in such a crooked and perverse generation as this is. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition seems to parallel with theirs very much, we lately were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sore and ciuel bondage, nothing was more dangerous then the worshipping God in his own way; we were under hard task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, oppressing, undoing Courts; the Lord hath in a great measure eased us, it is the unthankfulness, the sinful distemper of mens spirits that makes them say, what is done? it is as ill with us, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was; No, we have much ease, such liberties, as were our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46468:19"/> forefathers raised out of their graves to see, they would admire Gods goodness, and bless him with meltings of heart, we spend that strength in siding, wrangling, contending, quarrelling, urging and oppressing one another, that we should spend in magnifying, blessing and praysing the name of God for that mercy we enjoy; we are a divided people whose hearts are divided, and heads too, and hands too; peace and unity seems to be flown from us, and a spirit of contention and division is come upon us; Kings and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are divided, Parliament is divided, Assembly is divided, Armies are divided, Church is divided, and State is divided, City is divided, Country is divided, Towns are divided, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies divided, Godly people are divided, Ministers almost every where are divided; yea, and what heart almost is there at this time, but is divided in it self? the thoughts, the counsels, contrivances, endeavours, wayes of men, almost of all men, how are they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? O blessed Saviour, are these the times thou speakest of, wherein five should be in one house divided, three against two and two against three; the Father against the Son, and the Son against the Father; the Mother against the Daughter, and the Daughter against the Mother? Oh woe unto us! we find it so amongst us, and yet there is found no healing; we are broken and there is no binding up; it is with us as it was with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and thornes are with us, and we dwell amongst scorpions.</hi> ▪ O Lord, what is this thy curse at this time upon <hi>England?</hi> briars and thornes shall it bring forth; we are rending and tearing, and devouring one another, while the adversary stands before us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is against <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> against <hi>Ephraim.</hi> A fire is come out from <hi>Abimelech</hi> and devours the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> and fire comes from the men of <hi>Shechem</hi> and devours <hi>Abimelech;</hi> yea there is a fire kindled in our own bowels, it rises from our selves. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a Scepter to rule; this is a lamentation, and shall be for a lawentation:</hi> this is amongst us at this day, and how long it shall continue, God only knows. What this people were in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46468:20"/> their divided condition, that we are; and what does this threaten but that we should be as they a while after this were? namely, a people given up to the rage and fury of the enemy, which the Lord forbid.</p>
               <p>The last witness I shall produce, is Mr. <hi>Stronge</hi> in his Sermon before the Lord Major and Aldermen of London, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1653. upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. pag. 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Consider the instruments that are abroad in the world; we read of frogs sent out of the mouth of the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. that is by his special command and commission, and these go forth unto the Kings of the earth in all shapes; and we have to fear (nay apparent ground to believe) that besides the men of corrupt minds risen up among our selves, there are many of those sent in among us; it were well if we could look upon our Cities, Army, Navy, yea Councels to be free; and so much the rather it is to be feared because we see all ancient Heresies revived. <hi>Arrians, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, Montanists, Patriparsians,</hi> yea that conceit of <hi>Joachim Abbas,</hi> that there is a Gospel of the Spirit, another Gospel then that preached by Christ; and to observe by what mean persons these Doctrines are vented, and yet all the ancient arguments used to maintain them; a considering man observing this, can hardly imagine, but that there be some that do secretly, and with the best advantage instill such into them, and that in an unobser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved way; for they are said to be spirits, that is, though they act very powerfully, yet invisibly; their motions, wayes and practises are not known. Consider that constant pressing of liberty of conscience, which if granted, must be universal, for who hath power to lay a restraint upon one mans conscience more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and therefore the patrons of this opinion do plead for a toleration of Popery, upon a religious account. As also that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Mariana</hi> the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> now so generally insisted upon, and pleaded for <hi>Princeps nil statuat de Religione,</hi> the magistrate is not to meddle with matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>These two principles received, lay all open to Popery or Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme; for if popery, as a religion, receive but a toleration, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46468:20"/> the same countenance that otheres do (it being a religion most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to nature, as corrupt, and so exactly fitted to it) it will soon have the most followers; for when Popery first appeared in the world, the whole world wondered after it, as it had done after Arianisme a little before. Look upon the Apostasie of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, men falling from all things in religion, and with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent face denying, deriding all; the Scriptures, the Trinity, the Godhead of Christ, his sufferings and satisfaction, justification by imputed righteousness, the Law of God as the rule of obedience, and whatsoever Doctrines Christian Religion is built upon: Now we know that a great Apostacy did make way for popery, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>

And there is great cause to fear, that the present Apostacy amongst us may have such a tendency; for we see men fall from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until they hold to nothing in matters of Religion; Such an Apostacy (as I think I may without breach of charity say) that there hath not been the like in any Christian Church since the great Apostasie before named: and being thus become as it were an outward Court, may we not fear that God should give us over to be trodden down of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Gentiles again? and not receiving the truth in the love thereof he should give us up to believe <hi>that lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See more, <hi>Ibid.</hi> for I am weary of holding the pen of those learned Scribes and writing after them, and my heart akes, and my spirit sinks within me to consider how many dreadful cleer warnings God has given by his spirit in the Prophets of these times, foretelling our ruine that is so nigh, and yet their words are laid aside, as if they had never been spoken, or pass as the winde which no one takes notice of. But to draw up my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in short from the testimonies of those worthy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Say now you that have heard the witnesses of God speak over again to you what they formerly delivered, What think you? doth not all that they have spoken amount to a confirmation of this truth in hand: That the present state of the Church is a state
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46468:21"/> of desertion in a great measure? though they say it not expresly yet do they not equivalently intimate it; do they not say that very condition in reality is befaln us that we call a true Desertion.</p>
               <p>If any one will be contentious farther I appeal to as many of those faithful Witnesses as are yet alive, and to all the faithful god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministers of these Nations, to say, whether all this horrible apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from God, his Ordinances and truth, which is confest; those vile and abhorred sins that are got loose amongst us, those sad and dismal temptations that make men weary of themselves; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all these mutations, overturnings, tempests, shipwracks, wherewith the Princes, Nobles, Ministers and People of this land have been broken before our eyes, whiles we live to observe them and tell posterity what sad Monuments of Gods displeasure lie along by our shore; whether all these sad calamities (I say) that have befallen us, do not witness a reall and plain desertion.</p>
               <p>The Lord convince us and our poor posterity after us of the present general judgment, that we or they may be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mighty hand, and cry mightily to God to stop it timely, before it make an utter end; for this is Gods method from which he varies not, that when he is in a way of desertion, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not to inflict one judgment after another, until he hath utterly consumed that impenitent people that contend with him.</p>
               <p>I thought to have struck off here, affecting brevity in this work that so it might be soon read over, but one objection farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires answer, and it is this.</p>
               <p>Grant there has been a great measure of Desertion upon the times, yet is it not now well over, is not the war at an end, and our swords beaten into plowshears, the adversary overcome and great rest given us on every side?</p>
               <p>Blessed be God for this, who has remembred mercy in the midst of judgment, and does not contend for ever; but this I take to be but a parly, a short breathing; did not God draw off <hi>Nebuchadnezers</hi> army from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and diverted him upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then afterwards set him on again, and caused him to lead away <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and all his Princes, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46468:21"/> the people of the land captive, and when they thought after this that the wrath of the Lord was at an end; do we not hear of <hi>Ishmaels</hi> mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre and carrying of <hi>Johanan</hi> and the remnant into <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is not then for us to be secure because God hath made a little stop; and I will give you my reasons for it, joyning testimony with a faithful Minister of God whom we have named before, Reverend Mr. <hi>Bridg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Because the hand of the Lord seemes to be stretched out still in a way of displeasure. What year hitherto produces not the sad effects and tokens of wrath, a breach upon Parliaments, a breach upon Princes, a breach upon the whole Church of God, and the holy Ministers of God, a breach upon man and beasts, a breach upon the fruits of the earth and trading of the Land. Surely we may conclude as the Prophet, <hi>That for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Reason, God is not reconciled to us, because we are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled one to another. Our love is a reflection of Gods love; his love is the cause of our love, and our love the sign of his love; so on the contrary: Therefore when the Lord had said of those evil times by the Prophet <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. v. 5. <hi>Trust ye not in any friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom, for the Son dishonoreth the Father, the Daughter riseth up against her Mother, the Daughter in law against her Mother in law; a mans enemies are they of his own house.</hi> What followes? Sure enough this is a sign of Gods anger upon the Nation; and therefore <hi>v.</hi> 9. it is added, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</hi> Alas! sayes the Church, God is out with us; we will humble our selves before the Lord, and bear the indignation of the Lord in all this, for the cause of all this evil is our sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reason, How can we think but that God is still angry with us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the former sins that God hath been punishing all this while, and which are the very causes of desolation do still abide amongst us.</p>

               <p n="4">4 Reas. That makes us conjecture further wrath, is the opinion of godly Divines &amp; learnedst Cronologers upon the times, expecting the slaying of the witnesses &amp; advancement of popery yet again, to which they conceive the mystery of iniquity works apace. Adde to this the inundation of the Emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into this land▪ the acceptation of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme and spiritual popery amongst the vulgar, the recess of many Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Divines and gentlemen unto that Church, and favourable compliance with the grand abettours thereof, and then consider what the end will be.</p>
               <p>Go to then, and let us draw up the conclusion of the whole matter: It is evident that the Church of God hath been for many years, and yet is under a great measure of desertion, which hath crept down along like a gangrene from the Churches of <hi>Germany, Bohemia,</hi> and others unto our dayes, and even to these Kingdomes, God striking all afar off before he would touch this choice and lovely vine of <hi>England,</hi> which he had high esteem for. Now what the end of the judgment will be the Lord only knowes, this we may humbly say, that as all desertions use to do, so this must at length fall into one of these points.</p>
               <p>Either an utter desolation and general ruine, or else through mercy and our repentance, a purifying of the house of God, and advancement of the true worship of God, and power and Kingdome of our Lord Jesus Christ amongst us or our posterity: If this lamentable desertion should end in a general ruine and desolation▪ Oh, what heart does not break to hear it. Surely it stands us upon to let fall all private interests and set our selves with perpetual fasting and humiliation to propitiate God, and regain his presence before he be utterly gone. Or if it be like to end well, as▪ sometimes terrible desertions doe, yet still it calls upon us mightily to seek God, and put away all that does offend him, that we may make way at length for mercy, that we perish not.</p>
               <p>Ah, who amongst us pitties not himself and his poor posterity, and the Church of God, and the Nation where his lines are cast? who lies a sleep like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the keel of the Ship when this tempest threatens us all? Oh, you Ship-masters, the Governors of the people of God go about and see, and if any sleep, rouze them by your authority; pity your selves and us who are in like danger, search what is the matter that withall this earnest rowing you cannot bring the Ship to land and set it in a safe harbour; Alas, we are like to perish, because in our vessel there is not only One <hi>Jonah</hi> asleep but Many.</p>
